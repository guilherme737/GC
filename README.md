# slimrest RESTful API
## based on slimframework3.0

this project provides scaffold for your next RESTful API.

## Additional Tools

This scaffold mashes additional libraries to get in shape, it uses [PHPActiveRecord ORM](http://www.phpactiverecord.org/) library for database manipulation, and uses [JWT](http://jwt.io/) for authentication/authorization with frontend.

Additional resources and tutorials based on the scaffold will be available here soon.
